## 📊 Overview
Briefly describe what the project does.  
For example:
> This project predicts housing prices in California using multiple regression models and compares their performance.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Clearly state the business or analytical problem you're solving.

> The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on various features like location, size, and age.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: [Link to Kaggle/UCI/GitHub/etc.]
- **Size**: ~15,000 rows, 12 columns
- **Key Features**:
  - `Area` - Size of the house (in sq ft)
  - `Location` - City or region
  - `Price` - Target variable (in USD)

---

## 🔍 Approach
Outline the steps you took:
- Data Cleaning & EDA
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Evaluation (RMSE, R²)

## ✅ Results
Highlight key findings, metrics, or visuals.

| Model            | RMSE  | R² Score |
|------------------|-------|----------|
| Linear Regression| 23456 | 0.78     |
| Random Forest    | 18321 | 0.86     |
| XGBoost          | 17210 | 0.89     |

*Best model: XGBoost with RMSE = 17,210*

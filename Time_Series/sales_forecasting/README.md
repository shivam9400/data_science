# 🛍️ Time Series Sales Forecasting Project

## 📌 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to build a model that forecasts daily sales for various stores and product families. The dataset contains historical sales data along with additional features such as promotions, oil prices, holidays, and store metadata. This predictive model can help businesses make better decisions in inventory management, promotional planning, and supply chain optimization.
